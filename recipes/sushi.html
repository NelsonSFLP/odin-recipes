    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sushi is an iconic Japanese cuisine that has captivated taste buds worldwide. 
        With a history dating back to the 8th century, sushi has evolved from a preservation method to an art form, showcasing the meticulous craftsmanship and attention to detail in Japanese culinary traditions.
        Originally, sushi was a means of preserving fish by fermenting it with rice and salt. Over time, the fermentation process was replaced by the use of vinegar, which gave rise to the sushi we know today. 
        Sushi is characterized by the combination of vinegared rice, known as "shari," and a variety of ingredients such as raw or cooked seafood, vegetables, and condiments.</p>
    
    <p>Sushi has become a culinary phenomenon, admired for its delicate flavors and beautiful presentation. 
        The artistry involved in sushi preparation is evident in the skilled hands of sushi chefs, who master the techniques of cutting fish, shaping rice, and arranging the ingredients with precision. 
        Beyond its gastronomic appeal, sushi embodies the Japanese philosophy of "umami," the delicate balance of flavors that delights the palate.
        In contemporary society, sushi has transcended cultural boundaries, becoming a global phenomenon. Sushi bars and restaurants can be found in countless cities worldwide, offering a taste of Japan's culinary heritage. 
        Whether enjoyed in traditional sushiya establishments or as convenient take-out options, sushi continues to captivate food enthusiasts, uniting people in their shared appreciation for this culinary art form.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/3 cups water</li>
        <li>2/3 cup uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
        <li>1/2 pound imitation crabmeat, flaked</li>
        <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted, and sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons pickled ginger</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>
        <li>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. 
            Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</li>
    </ol>
